Was quickly hacked up from the source for xkcd in a matter 
of hours and for which reason, there wasn't enough time to
write the credits myself. I'm including the credits from 
the uni.xkcd(github.com/chromacode/xkcdfools) source.

Tonnes of thanks to Chromacode for having the source for 
free :)
Thanks to Simula67 for helping me out when google wasn't
enough. 
And even more for the asses who did the site to resemble
windows - and piss me off, LOL :
